# Highest Number Cubed

Sometimes you can use programming to solve problems that would otherwise be difficult.
For example, can you think of the highest number that, when cubed, is less than 12,000?
Even using a calculator you would probably have to manually guess numbers until you figure it out.
Our first group project will be to write a program that receives an upper limit and figures this out for you!

It will be guided by a mentor and done as a class to get everyone used to the process of
setting up and coding from a github repo to cloud9.


```python
>>> highest_number_cubed(30)
3
>>> highest_number_cubed(3)
1
```
